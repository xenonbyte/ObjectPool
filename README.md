# ObjectPool

An object reuse pool suitable for scenes where objects are frequently created and destroyed. If an instance exists in the reuse pool, the instance is reused; if not, a new instance is created.

[中文说明](README-zh.md)

## Use

### creating a global object reuse pool
```kotlin
val pool = ObjectPoolProvider.global().get(Person::class.java, object : ObjectFactory<Person> {
    override fun create(vararg args: Any?): Person {
        val name = args[0] as String
        val age = args[1] as Int
        return Person(name, age)
    }

    override fun reuse(instance: Person, vararg args: Any?) {
        val name = args[0] as String
        val age = args[1] as Int
        instance.name = name
        instance.age = age
    }

})
```

### use `ObjectPoolStoreOwner` instance to create an object reuse pool
```kotlin
val store = ObjectPoolStore()
val storeOwner = object : ObjectPoolStoreOwner {
    override val store: ObjectPoolStore
        get() = store

}
val pool = ObjectPoolProvider.create(storeOwner).get(Person::class.java, object : ObjectFactory<Person> {
    override fun create(vararg args: Any?): Person {
        val name = args[0] as String
        val age = args[1] as Int
        return Person(name, age)
    }

    override fun reuse(instance: Person, vararg args: Any?) {
        val name = args[0] as String
        val age = args[1] as Int
        instance.name = name
        instance.age = age
    }

})
```

### get instance
get the object instance from the object reuse pool. If the instance exists in the reuse pool, reuse the instance; if not, create a new instance
```kotlin
val person = pool.obtain("Andy", 16);
```
### recycle instance
the object reuse pool recycles objects to facilitate instance reuse
```kotlin
pool.recycle(person)
```
### implementing the `Reusable` interface
Object classes managed by the object reuse pool must implement `Reusable`
```kotlin
class Person(var name: String, var age: Int) : Reusable
```
